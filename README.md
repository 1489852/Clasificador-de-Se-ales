This work has focused on the study of one of the modules of autonomous driving, traffic sign prediction. To this end, an  application has been developed to detect and classify traffic signs in real time using computer vision. The application using video input and a previously trained neural network is able to generate outputs predicting the signal shown in the image. To this end, throughout the project, neural networks with changing characteristics have been trained in order to learn about their  behaviour. By extracting conclusions and results from the data extracted from the trained neural networks, it has been possible  to generate a solid functional model that makes predictions in real time.
